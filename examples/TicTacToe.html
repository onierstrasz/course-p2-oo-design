<h1>P2 TicTacToe Examples</h1>

<p>The TicTacToe game is used in lectures 5-7.  We iteratively 
develop a simple ascii game in lecture 5 (versions 0-2).  In lecture 6 
we then refactor the game and use inheritance to handle as well Gomoku, a 
similar game played on a Go board (versions 3-6).  Next, in lecture 7 
we develop a GUI interface using the Java AWT (version 7-8).  
Finally, we distribute the game using RMI (version 9).  
During each iteration, we make sure all our regression tests run before 
freezing the version.</p>

<p>The notes that follow below document the refactoring steps taken as new 
features are added.  They are meant to complement the lecture notes, not 
replace them.</p>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<h2>Iterative Development &mdash; Basic Game Logic</h2>

<p>Here we iteratively develop classes to play the game of 
TicTacToe.</p>

<h3>Version 0</h3>

<p>First we implement an empty skeleton consisting of the classes TicTacToe (modeling the game) and GameDriver (to start the game). This version does nothing but run.</p>

<p>Note that the version numbers are actually cvs tags for complete versions of the game, and do not refer to the revision numbers of the individual files.</p>

<h3>Version 1</h3>

<p>Now we model the game state.
We add TicTacToeTest.testState to exercise game state.
We add TicTacToe getters and setters to access the game state (using chess notation).
We also add preconditions to the getters and setters, and we define TicTacToe.toString to visualize game state</p>


<h3>Version 2</h3>

<p>Now we add the game logic.
This is the first usable game with a primitive ascii interface.
We add test scenarios to TicTacToeTest in which we play a complete game and check the winner and the number of squares left.
We also add a Player class and a special constructor for scripted moves.</p>

<p>The TicTacToe class has been completed 
to maintain the game invariants, and we explicitly check pre-conditions and 
invariants at various points.  Note that the logic of 
TicTacToe.checkWinner() is ugly -- checking for rows, columns or diagonals 
should perhaps be factored out to a separate, more generic method.</p>

<p>We add TicTacToe methods to move, and test for winning.
Finally we expand the GameDriver to instantiate Player and trigger moves.</p>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<HR/>
<h2>Inheritance &mdash; Gomoku</h2>

<p>In versions 1 through 6
iteratively refactor TicTacToe so that it inherits from an 
AbstractBoardGame, which in turn implements a BoardGame interface.  Gomoku 
is a similar game that shares the same interface and almost all of the same 
implementation.  The refactoring steps change the TicTacToe design so that 
the two games can share as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Version 3</h3>

<p>In version 3 we add the BoardGame interface and patch the GameDriver and 
TicTacToe to use that interface.  We also patch the tests to be silent by 
default. We do this by introducing a NullOutputStream which simply discards its input.
We move all printing from Player etc. to GameDriver (now we need BoardGame.currentPlayer()).
We change GameDriver to print to a PrintStream, and TicTacToeTest to play the game with a PrintStream(new NullOutputStream).</p>

<h3>Version 4</h3>

<p>Now we introduce the AbstractBoardGame class which implements methods 
common to TicTacToe and Gomoku.  In the end, it implements everything 
except the TicTacToe constructor.  Methods that previously were private in 
TicTacToe 3 are now protected in AbstractBoardGame.  We patch Player to 
use the BoardGame interface instead of the concrete TicTacToe class.</p>

<h3>Version 5</h3>

<p>Now we check which parts of AbstractBoardGame are generic and can be used 
for both TicTacToe and Gomoku.  The number of rows and columns are fine.  
We introduce an abstract init() method to initialize the rows, columns & score.
We patch the set() and get() methods 
to be indexed by ints instead of chars.  move() now is indexed by String 
coordinates which are parsed by getCol() and getRow().  toString() must be 
rewritten.  We must similarly rewrite inRange(), invariant() and test().
We patch toString() and checkWinner()  
Finally we patch the BoardGame interface and its clients, including the 
GameDriver.
<p><h3>Version 6</h3>

<p>Finally we are ready to introduce Gomoku.  Its implementation is trivial -- 
like TicTacToe, it just extends AbstractBoardGame by overriding the Template method init().
Modify GameDriver to query the user for either TicTacToe or Gomoku.
We introduce AbstractBoardGameTest so that TicTacToeTest and GomokuTest can share common methods, auch as assertFails(Runnable).</p>

<p>The hardest part is to reimplement checkWinner() -- the 
algorithm to check if one of the players has won the game.  We introduce 
the notion of a Runner -- an object that starts from the last position 
played and runs in both directions (horizontally, vertically and 
diagonally) to see if the winning number of squares have been occupied.  To 
implement Runner, BoardGame.get() and inRange() must be public.  We patch 
GameDriver to query the user for TicTacToe or Gomoku, run our tests, and we 
are done!</p>


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<HR/>
<h2>GUI Construction</h2>

<p>We will introduce a GUI for the (single-user) game in several steps.</p>

<h3>Version 7</h3>

<p>We start by introduce a new package, p2.tictactoe.gui.
We introduce GameGUI (as subclass of Frame), Place (a place on the board), PlaceListener (to listen to mouse clicks) and GUIplayer (to represent the Player).
We change Player to be an interface.
We also introduce InactivePlayer (to represent the Player "nobody") and StreamPlayer (which gets its moves from a Stream).</p>

<p>A GUI architecture requires that the BoardGame and Player both be passive (since 
they passively wait for mouse events to happen, rather than actively 
querying for a String input).  We consequently must shift some 
responsibilities between the BoardGame and Player classes.  We remove 
BoardGame.update() and shift this responsibility to
GameDriver.playGame().  (We run our tests and continue.)</p>

<p>We cannot force jar files to enable assertions, so we replace the java assertions by our own myAssert() method.
We must accordingly adapt GameDriver, StreamPlayer, PlaceListener etc.</p>

<h3>Version 8</h3>

<p>We will need separate views for the two players, and we will need a way to instantiate either TicTacToe or Gomoku.
We introduce GameConsole to start the two games.
We also TicTacToe and Gomoku factory methods to GameGUI.
When a game is over, the same players may want to continue, so we add BoardGame.restart() to restart (re-initialize) a game.</p>

<p>We must only create one game for every two Players, so we need a "factory" to instantiate games only when we need them.
We add GameFactory and two subclasses to create TicTacToe & Gomoku.
We modify AbstractBoardGame and GameGUI to keep track of which Player they represent.
We add BoardGame methods join() and ready() to join a game and to know when there are two Players ready to play.
We introduce further error-checking by throwing InvalidMoveException with messages indicating that game is not ready or that it is not your turn.
We patch the tests to call game.join() twice.</p>

<h3>Version 9</h3>

<p>Now we will start to distribute the game.</p>

<p>We first introduce new packages p2.tictactoe.rmi for the remote interfaces and p2.tictactoe.server for the server implementations.
We add Remote interfaces for GameServer, Game and Observer.
We also convert Move to be Serializable and adapt all classes that use it.</p>

<p>We add GameServer, GameProxy and GameObserver, which implement the Remote interfaces.
Java doesn't support multiple inheritance.  Since GameView already extends 
Frame, we must introduce a separate GameObserver that extends UnicastRemoteObject to 
handle observer updates. <p></p>

<p>We now convert the GUI components to depend on RemoteGame instead of BoardGame.
We add BoardGame.addObserver(RemoteGame).
We rewrite GameConsole to build a local GUI connected to a RemoteGame and weadapt GameGUI to act as a view for a RemoteGame.
We change Place to work with a local mark (char) rather than a (remote) Player.
We must also rewrite PlaceListener.mouseClicked() to work with RemoteGame.
We check that all the game tests still pass.</p>

<p>We fix the ant build.xml to call rmic for the three server classes.
We add shell commands to start and kill the server and to start the client.</p>

<p>Our server objects (GameServer and GameProxy) are liable to receiving 
concurrent requests from clients, so we must declare the public methods as 
synchronized (this goes beyond what we can cover in this course!).  
(GameObserver.update() doesn't need to be synchronized, because it can 
never be called concurrently?  Nothing else on client side might get 
concurrent updates since updates only come from server!)  
GameServer.joinTicTacToe() must be synchronized since state is modified 
here (alternatively, we synchronize GameFactory.getGame()).
GameProxy methods must be synchronized, but the BoardGame it wraps
must not be (to avoid nested monitor problems). <p></p>
